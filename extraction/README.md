# Extraction

Contains two implementations:

* pretty-printing procedure from the deep embedding into the Liquidity syntax. Smart contracts have to be written in ``Î»smart`` using the notations.

* extraction using MetaCoq's certified erasure. Extracts smart contracts impelemted in Gallina. Can handle some form of dependent types. Currently supports Liquidity as a target language.
